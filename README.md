# IntelLiGent Battery Knowledge Navigator

## Overview
The IntelLiGent Battery Knowledge Navigator provides an innovative battery data management and analysis platform. It seamlessly integrates semantic technologies (RDF, SPARQL, BattINFO ontology) with an SQL database infrastructure, streamlining battery research data storage and analysis. Developed as part of the Horizon Europe research project IntelLiGent, this tool stands at the forefront of advancing battery technologies.

## Features
- **Semantic Integration:** Harnesses RDF, BattINFO ontology, and SPARQL to form a comprehensive knowledge graph for intricate data linkages.
- **SQL Data Management:** Efficiently manages large-scale time-series and cycle-series battery datasets, ensuring scalability and integrity.
- **Interactive UI:** Facilitates effortless data entry, retrieval, and analysis while adhering to FAIR principles.
- **Integration Potential:** Forward-looking approach with planned seamless interactions with the Galvanalyser platform for direct data exchange.
